# Select2-Angular4

## Prerequisites

For this plugin to work you need to add two javascript libraries to your project
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/download/)
- [Select2](https://select2.github.io/)

First option and **preferred one** is to add libraries to your package builder.
- You can find example of how to add libraries to the Angular CLI in [demo repository](https://github.com/NejcZdovc/ng2-select2-demo/blob/master/angular-cli.json#L24-L25). 
- You can also add it to [webpack directly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28969861/managing-jquery-plugin-dependency-in-webpack#answer-2898947). 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.
